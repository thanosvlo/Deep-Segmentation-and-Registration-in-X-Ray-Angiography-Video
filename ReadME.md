Code implementation of BMVC 2018 paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06406 


File contains implementation of last part of pipeline, the Siamese U-Net. 
The other elements of the pipeline are easily made with this file. 

Complete cleaned implementation will follow soon

abstract = {In interventional radiology, short video sequences of vein structure in motion are captured in order to help medical personnel identify vascular issues or plan intervention. Semantic segmentation can greatly improve the usefulness of these videos by indicating exact position of vessels and instruments, thus reducing the ambiguity. We propose a real-time segmentation method for these tasks, based on U-Net network trained in a Siamese architecture from automatically generated annotations. We make use of noisy low level binary segmentation and optical flow to generate multiclass annotations that are successively improved in a multistage segmentation approach. We significantly improve the performance of a state of the art U-Net at the processing speeds of 90fps.},
